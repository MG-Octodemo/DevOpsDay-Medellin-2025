# Test Strategy: [Feature Name]

## Test Strategy Overview

[Provide a comprehensive summary of testing approach based on ISTQB and ISO 25010 frameworks]

## ISTQB Framework Application

**Test Design Techniques Used:**
- [ ] Equivalence Partitioning: [Describe input domain partitioning strategy]
- [ ] Boundary Value Analysis: [Describe edge case identification approach]
- [ ] Decision Table Testing: [Describe complex business rule validation]
- [ ] State Transition Testing: [Describe system state behavior validation]
- [ ] Experience-Based Testing: [Describe exploratory and error guessing approaches]

**Test Types Coverage:**
- [ ] Functional Testing: [Describe feature behavior validation approach]
- [ ] Non-Functional Testing: [Describe performance, usability, security validation]
- [ ] Structural Testing: [Describe code coverage and architecture validation]
- [ ] Change-Related Testing: [Describe regression and confirmation testing approach]

## ISO 25010 Quality Characteristics

**Priority Assessment:**
- [ ] Functional Suitability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Rationale]
- [ ] Performance Efficiency: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Rationale]
- [ ] Compatibility: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Rationale]
- [ ] Usability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Rationale]
- [ ] Reliability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Rationale]
- [ ] Security: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Rationale]
- [ ] Maintainability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Rationale]
- [ ] Portability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Rationale]

**Quality Characteristics Validation Plan:**

- Staging Environment: [Describe production-like configuration needs]
- Production Environment: [Describe monitoring and validation requirements]

**Test Data Management:**
- Data Categories: [Describe user profiles, scenarios, edge cases]
- Data Privacy: [Describe GDPR compliance and data handling strategy]
- Data Generation: [Describe synthetic data creation approach]

**Tool Selection:**
- Testing Frameworks: [List and justify testing tool selections]
- Performance Testing: [Describe load testing and benchmarking tools]
- Security Testing: [Describe vulnerability scanning and assessment tools]

## Quality Gates

**Entry Criteria:**
- [ ] [List specific conditions required to begin testing phase]
- [ ] [Include dependency completion requirements]
- [ ] [Include environment readiness criteria]

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] [List specific quality standards for phase completion]
- [ ] [Include coverage and success rate requirements]

- Security Standards: [Specify vulnerability tolerance levels]

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**High Risk Areas:**
- [Risk 1]: [Impact description] - [Mitigation strategy]
- [Risk 2]: [Impact description] - [Mitigation strategy]

**Medium Risk Areas:**
- [Risk 1]: [Impact description] - [Mitigation strategy]
- [Risk 2]: [Impact description] - [Mitigation strategy]

**Risk Monitoring:**
- [Describe risk tracking and early warning indicators]
- [Define escalation procedures for risk materialization]

## Success Metrics

**Test Coverage Metrics:**
- Code Coverage: [Target percentage] for [component types]
- Functional Coverage: [Target percentage] for acceptance criteria validation
- Risk Coverage: [Target percentage] for high-risk scenario testing

**Quality Validation Metrics:**
- Defect Detection Rate: [Target percentage] of defects found before production
- Test Execution Efficiency: [Target percentage] test automation coverage
- Quality Gate Compliance: [Target percentage] quality gates passed
- Performance Compliance: [Target response times and throughput]

## Acceptance Criteria
