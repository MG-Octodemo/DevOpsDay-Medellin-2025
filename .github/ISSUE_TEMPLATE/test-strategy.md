# Test Strategy: [Feature Name]

## Test Strategy Overview

**Summary of testing approach based on ISTQB and ISO 25010**

*Provide a comprehensive overview of the testing strategy, including scope, objectives, and methodological approach following ISTQB framework and ISO 25010 quality model.*

## ISTQB Framework Application

### Test Design Techniques Used:
- [ ] **Equivalence Partitioning**: Input domain partitioning strategy
- [ ] **Boundary Value Analysis**: Edge case identification and testing
- [ ] **Decision Table Testing**: Complex business rule validation
- [ ] **State Transition Testing**: System state behavior validation  
- [ ] **Experience-Based Testing**: Exploratory and error guessing approaches

*Detail which techniques will be applied and rationale for selection*

### Test Types Coverage:
- [ ] **Functional Testing**: Feature behavior validation
  - [ ] Unit Testing: Component-level validation
  - [ ] Integration Testing: Interface testing
  - [ ] System Testing: End-to-end validation
- [ ] **Non-Functional Testing**: Quality characteristic validation
  - [ ] Performance Testing: Response time and load validation
  - [ ] Usability Testing: User experience validation
  - [ ] Security Testing: Security requirement validation
- [ ] **Structural Testing**: Code coverage and architecture validation
  - [ ] Statement Coverage: Line-by-line coverage
  - [ ] Branch Coverage: Decision point coverage
  - [ ] Path Coverage: Execution path validation
- [ ] **Change-Related Testing**: Regression and confirmation testing
  - [ ] Regression Testing: Existing functionality validation
  - [ ] Confirmation Testing: Bug fix validation

## ISO 25010 Quality Characteristics

### Priority Assessment:
- [ ] **Functional Suitability**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low} - *Rationale for priority level*
- [ ] **Performance Efficiency**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low} - *Rationale for priority level*
- [ ] **Compatibility**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low} - *Rationale for priority level*
- [ ] **Usability**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low} - *Rationale for priority level*
- [ ] **Reliability**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low} - *Rationale for priority level*
- [ ] **Security**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low} - *Rationale for priority level*
- [ ] **Maintainability**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low} - *Rationale for priority level*
- [ ] **Portability**: {Critical/High/Medium/Low} - *Rationale for priority level*

*For each characteristic, provide detailed testing approach and success criteria*

## Test Environment and Data Strategy

### Environment Requirements:
- [ ] **Development Environment**: Local testing setup requirements
- [ ] **Staging Environment**: Pre-production testing requirements  
- [ ] **Production Environment**: Live environment validation requirements

### Test Data Management:
- [ ] **Mock Data**: Synthetic test data requirements
- [ ] **Real Data**: Production-like data requirements (anonymized)
- [ ] **Edge Case Data**: Boundary and error condition data
- [ ] **Performance Data**: Large dataset requirements for load testing

### Tool Selection:
- [ ] **Testing Frameworks**: {List primary testing tools}
- [ ] **Automation Tools**: {List automation platforms}
- [ ] **Performance Tools**: {List performance testing tools}
- [ ] **Security Tools**: {List security testing tools}

## Quality Gates

### Entry Criteria:
- [ ] **Requirements Documented**: All acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] **Technical Specifications**: Architecture and design completed
- [ ] **Environment Ready**: Test environments configured

- [ ] **Defect Density**: < 5 defects per 1000 lines of code
- [ ] **Performance**: Page load < 2 seconds, API response < 500ms
- [ ] **Accessibility**: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Areas:
1. **{Risk Area 1}**: {Description and mitigation strategy}
2. **{Risk Area 2}**: {Description and mitigation strategy}

### Medium Risk Areas:
1. **{Risk Area 1}**: {Description and mitigation strategy}
2. **{Risk Area 2}**: {Description and mitigation strategy}

### Contingency Plans:
- [ ] **Scope Reduction**: Features that can be descoped if needed
- [ ] **Timeline Extension**: Additional time allocation for critical issues
- [ ] **Resource Reallocation**: Cross-team support strategies

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Metrics:
- [ ] **Functional Coverage**: 100% acceptance criteria validation
- [ ] **Risk Coverage**: 100% high-risk scenarios tested
- [ ] **Code Coverage**: {Specific percentage targets}

### Quality Metrics:
- [ ] **Defect Detection Rate**: 95% of defects found before production
- [ ] **Test Automation Coverage**: 90% of tests automated
- [ ] **Performance Compliance**: 100% performance requirements met

## Acceptance Criteria
