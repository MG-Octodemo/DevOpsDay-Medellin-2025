# Test Strategy: [Feature Name]

## Test Strategy Overview

**Brief description of the testing approach based on ISTQB and ISO 25010 frameworks**

## ISTQB Framework Application

**Test Design Techniques Used:**
- [ ] Equivalence Partitioning: [Description of input domain partitioning]
- [ ] Boundary Value Analysis: [Edge case identification strategy]
- [ ] Decision Table Testing: [Complex business rule validation approach]
- [ ] State Transition Testing: [System state behavior validation method]
- [ ] Experience-Based Testing: [Exploratory and error guessing approaches]

**Test Types Coverage:**
- [ ] Functional Testing: [Feature behavior validation scope]
- [ ] Non-Functional Testing: [Performance, usability, security validation scope]
- [ ] Structural Testing: [Code coverage and architecture validation scope]
- [ ] Change-Related Testing: [Regression and confirmation testing scope]

## ISO 25010 Quality Characteristics

**Priority Assessment:**
- [ ] Functional Suitability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]
- [ ] Performance Efficiency: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]
- [ ] Compatibility: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]
- [ ] Usability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]
- [ ] Reliability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]
- [ ] Security: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]
- [ ] Maintainability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]
- [ ] Portability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]

## Test Environment Requirements

**Environment Setup:**
- [ ] Test environment configuration requirements
- [ ] Test data preparation needs
- [ ] Tool and framework requirements
- [ ] CI/CD integration requirements

## Quality Gates

**Entry Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific entry requirement 1]
- [ ] [Specific entry requirement 2]
- [ ] [Specific entry requirement 3]

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific exit requirement 1]
- [ ] [Specific exit requirement 2]
- [ ] [Specific exit requirement 3]

**Quality Thresholds:**
- [ ] Code coverage target: [percentage]%
- [ ] Performance benchmark: [specific metric]
- [ ] Security requirement: [specific control]
- [ ] Accessibility standard: [specific compliance level]

## Risk Assessment

**High-Risk Areas:**
- [Risk 1]: [Mitigation strategy]
- [Risk 2]: [Mitigation strategy]

**Medium-Risk Areas:**
- [Risk 1]: [Mitigation strategy]
- [Risk 2]: [Mitigation strategy]

## Dependencies

**Implementation Dependencies:**
- [ ] [Dependency 1 with linked issue]
- [ ] [Dependency 2 with linked issue]

**Environment Dependencies:**
- [ ] [Environment requirement 1]
- [ ] [Environment requirement 2]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test strategy document reviewed and approved
- [ ] Quality gates defined and validated
- [ ] Risk assessment completed and mitigation plans approved
- [ ] Test environment requirements documented and feasible
- [ ] Team alignment on testing approach achieved

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All quality characteristics assessed and prioritized
- [ ] ISTQB techniques selected and justified
- [ ] Quality gates with measurable criteria defined
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies documented
- [ ] Stakeholder review and approval completed

## Estimate

**Strategic planning effort: [2-3 story points]**
