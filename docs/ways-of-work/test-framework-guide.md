# Test Planning and Quality Assurance Framework

## Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive approach to test planning and quality assurance based on ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) standards and ISO 25010 quality model. It's designed to generate systematic test strategies, task breakdowns, and quality validation plans for GitHub project management.

```

### 2. GitHub Issue Templates
- **Test Strategy**: Comprehensive testing approach and framework application
- **Playwright E2E Tests**: End-to-end user workflow validation
- **Quality Assurance**: ISO 25010 quality characteristic validation
- **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing with coverage targets
- **Integration Tests**: API and service integration validation

## ISTQB Framework Application

### Test Design Techniques
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Input domain classification for comprehensive coverage
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Edge case identification and systematic testing
- **Decision Table Testing**: Complex business rule validation matrices
- **State Transition Testing**: System behavior and workflow validation
- **Experience-Based Testing**: Exploratory testing and error guessing

### Test Types Coverage
- **Functional Testing**: Feature behavior and requirement validation
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Performance, usability, security, and reliability
- **Structural Testing**: Code coverage and architecture validation
- **Change-Related Testing**: Regression and confirmation testing

## ISO 25010 Quality Model

### Quality Characteristics Priority Matrix
1. **Functional Suitability**: Completeness, correctness, appropriateness
2. **Performance Efficiency**: Time behavior, resource utilization, capacity
3. **Compatibility**: Co-existence and interoperability
4. **Usability**: User interface, accessibility, and experience
5. **Reliability**: Fault tolerance, recoverability, availability
6. **Security**: Confidentiality, integrity, authentication
7. **Maintainability**: Modularity, reusability, testability
8. **Portability**: Adaptability, installability, replaceability

## Quality Gates and Standards

### Entry Criteria
- Requirements documented with acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications completed
- Test environment configured
- Test data prepared

### Exit Criteria
- All planned tests executed (95% pass rate minimum)
- Coverage targets achieved (80% code, 100% requirements)
- Quality metrics satisfied
- Stakeholder approval obtained

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: 80% line, 90% branch for critical paths
- **Defect Density**: < 5 defects per 1000 lines of code
- **Performance**: Page load < 2s, API response < 500ms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## GitHub Project Management Integration

### Labeling Strategy
- **Test Types**: `unit-test`, `integration-test`, `e2e-test`, `performance-test`
- **Quality Framework**: `istqb`, `iso25010`, `quality-gates`
- **Priority**: `test-critical`, `test-high`, `test-medium`, `test-low`
- **Components**: `frontend-test`, `backend-test`, `api-test`

### Priority Assessment
Risk-based prioritization using impact and probability matrices:
- **Critical**: High impact + High probability
- **High**: High impact + Medium probability OR Medium impact + High probability
- **Medium**: Medium impact + Medium probability
- **Low**: Low impact + Any probability

## Estimation Guidelines

### Story Point Allocation
- **Test Strategy**: 2-3 story points (strategic planning)
- **Unit Tests**: 0.5-1 story point per component
- **Integration Tests**: 1-2 story points per interface
- **E2E Tests**: 2-3 story points per user workflow
- **Performance Tests**: 3-5 story points per requirement
- **QA Validation**: 3-5 story points per feature

### Estimation Factors
- Technical complexity
- Testing scope breadth
- Tool and framework maturity
- Team experience and velocity
- Risk and uncertainty levels

## Test Automation Strategy

### Automation Framework Selection
- **Unit Testing**: Jest (backend), React Testing Library (frontend)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for cross-browser automation
- **API Testing**: Supertest for REST endpoint validation
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- **Accessibility Testing**: axe-core, WAVE

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated test execution on every commit
- Quality gate enforcement before deployment
- Coverage reporting and threshold validation
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## Success Metrics

### Test Coverage Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: 80% line coverage minimum
- **Functional Coverage**: 100% acceptance criteria validation
- **Risk Coverage**: 100% high-risk scenario testing
- **Quality Characteristics**: All applicable ISO 25010 characteristics

### Process Efficiency Metrics
- **Test Planning Time**: 2 hours for comprehensive strategy
- **Test Implementation Speed**: 1 day per story point
- **Quality Feedback Time**: 2 hours from completion to assessment
- **Documentation Completeness**: 100% template compliance

## Implementation Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Create Feature Documentation**: Use provided templates for PRD, technical breakdown, and implementation plan
