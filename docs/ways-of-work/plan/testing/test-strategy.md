- Data storage and management (in-memory stores for talks, users, registrations)
- Email notification services
- User authentication and authorization flows
- Cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness
- Performance and security characteristics

**Out of Scope:**
- Third-party email service provider testing
- Infrastructure and deployment environment testing
- Load testing beyond basic performance validation

### Quality Objectives

- **Functional Correctness**: 100% of acceptance criteria validated through automated tests
- **Code Coverage**: 80% line coverage, 90% branch coverage for critical paths
- **Performance**: API response times ≤ 200ms for 95% of requests

- **Cross-Browser**: Support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **Mobile**: Responsive design tested on common device sizes

### Risk Assessment

**High-Risk Areas:**
- User authentication and session management
- Registration capacity management and constraints

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive security testing of authentication flows
- Boundary value testing for registration limits
- Mock email services for reliable testing
- Concurrency testing for race conditions

### Test Approach

Testing methodology combining automated and manual approaches following ISTQB guidelines with continuous integration and risk-based prioritization.

## ISTQB Framework Implementation

### Test Design Techniques Selection

#### Equivalence Partitioning
**Application Areas:**
- User input validation (email formats, password requirements)
- Talk registration capacity (available/full states)
- User role permissions (authenticated/unauthenticated users)
- Date/time validation for talk schedules

**Implementation:**
- Valid/invalid email address partitions
- Password strength categories (weak/medium/strong)
- Registration status partitions (open/closed/full)

#### Boundary Value Analysis
**Application Areas:**
- Maximum attendee limits for talks
- Password length requirements (minimum/maximum)
- Date ranges for talk scheduling
- Input field character limits

**Implementation:**
- Test at minimum, maximum, and just outside boundaries
- Registration capacity: 0, 1, maxAttendees-1, maxAttendees, maxAttendees+1
- Password length: 7, 8, 50, 51 characters

#### Decision Table Testing
**Application Areas:**
- User registration business rules
- Talk access permissions based on user state
- Email notification triggers
- Authentication and authorization decisions

**Implementation:**
- User registration: combinations of authentication status, talk availability, registration status
- Email triggers: registration success/failure combinations with notification preferences

#### State Transition Testing
**Application Areas:**
- User authentication states (logged out → logged in → logged out)
- Talk registration workflow (browsing → selecting → registering → confirmation)
- Password reset process
- Registration cancellation flow

**Implementation:**
- State diagrams for authentication flow
- Transition coverage for registration workflow
- Invalid state transition testing

#### Experience-Based Testing
**Application Areas:**
- Exploratory testing of user workflows
