# Test Strategy: Agenda Management

## Test Strategy Overview

This test strategy provides comprehensive testing approach for the Agenda Management feature based on ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) framework and ISO 25010 quality model. The strategy ensures thorough validation of functional requirements, non-functional characteristics, and quality attributes.

### Testing Scope
- **Features to Test**: Calendar view, talk details, filtering, search, PDF parsing, responsive design
- **Components to Test**: Frontend React components, Backend API endpoints, Data models, PDF service
- **Integration Points**: API-Frontend communication, Calendar library integration, PDF processing
- **Out of Scope**: Third-party library internals, Browser-specific implementations

### Quality Objectives
- **Functional Correctness**: 100% acceptance criteria validation
- **Performance**: Page load time < 2 seconds, API response time < 500ms
- **Usability**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, Mobile-first responsive design
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, Error recovery mechanisms
- **Security**: Input validation, XSS prevention, API security

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| PDF parsing failures | High | Medium | Comprehensive test data coverage, fallback mechanisms |
| Calendar performance | Medium | Low | Performance testing, optimization validation |
| Mobile compatibility | Medium | Medium | Cross-device testing, responsive design validation |
| API reliability | High | Low | Error handling tests, timeout management |

### Test Approach
- **Test-Driven Development**: Unit tests written before implementation
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on high-risk areas (PDF parsing, calendar integration)
- **Continuous Testing**: Automated tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Exploratory Testing**: Manual testing for usability and edge cases

## ISTQB Framework Implementation

### Test Design Techniques Selection

#### 1. Equivalence Partitioning
**Application**: Input validation testing
- **Valid Partitions**: Valid talk data, proper date formats, acceptable filter values
- **Invalid Partitions**: Malformed JSON, invalid dates, empty required fields
- **Boundary Conditions**: Maximum text lengths, date ranges, numeric limits

**Test Cases**:
- Valid talk creation with all required fields
- Invalid talk creation with missing required fields
- Edge case data at maximum field lengths

#### 2. Boundary Value Analysis
**Application**: Date/time handling, data limits
- **Lower Boundaries**: Minimum date values, zero attendee limits
- **Upper Boundaries**: Maximum date ranges, attendee capacity limits
- **Edge Cases**: Daylight saving transitions, timezone boundaries

**Test Cases**:
- Conference dates at year boundaries
- Talk duration edge cases (0 minutes, 24+ hours)
- Maximum attendee capacity validation

#### 3. Decision Table Testing
**Application**: Complex filtering logic, business rules
- **Conditions**: User authentication, filter combinations, permission levels
- **Actions**: Display filtered results, show error messages, redirect users

**Decision Table Example**:
| User Auth | Filter Type | Data Available | Action |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Yes | Tag | Yes | Show filtered talks |
| Yes | Tag | No | Show "no results" |
| No | Any | Any | Redirect to login |

#### 4. State Transition Testing
**Application**: UI state management, modal interactions
- **States**: Calendar view, modal open, filter active, loading state
- **Transitions**: User actions, API responses, error conditions
- **Invalid Transitions**: Direct state jumps, unauthorized actions

**State Model**:
```
Calendar View → [Click Talk] → Modal Open → [Close] → Calendar View
Calendar View → [Apply Filter] → Filtered View → [Clear] → Calendar View
Any State → [API Error] → Error State → [Retry] → Previous State
```

#### 5. Experience-Based Testing
**Application**: Usability validation, edge case discovery
- **Error Guessing**: Common user mistakes, typical system failures
- **Exploratory Testing**: Unscripted testing for usability issues
- **Checklist-Based**: Accessibility, security, performance checklists
