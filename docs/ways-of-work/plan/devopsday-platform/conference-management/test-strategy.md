# Test Strategy: DevOpsDay Platform - Conference Management

## Test Strategy Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the DevOpsDay Medellin 2025 platform, focusing on the conference management features including calendar view, talk management, user authentication, and registration systems. The strategy is based on ISTQB frameworks and ISO 25010 quality standards to ensure robust, reliable, and user-friendly conference platform.

## ISTQB Framework Application

### Test Design Techniques Selection

**Equivalence Partitioning:**
- User input validation (email formats, password requirements)
- Talk scheduling time slots and capacity limits
- Registration status categories (registered, waitlisted, cancelled)

**Boundary Value Analysis:**
- Maximum attendee limits for talks
- Date/time boundaries for conference scheduling
- Input field length limits (names, descriptions, bio fields)
- Session timeout boundaries

**Decision Table Testing:**
- User registration eligibility based on multiple conditions
- Talk registration logic (capacity, timing conflicts, prerequisites)
- Authentication flow decisions (valid/invalid credentials, account states)

**State Transition Testing:**
- User authentication states (logged out, logged in, session expired)
- Talk registration states (available, full, cancelled, completed)
- User account states (active, pending verification, suspended)

**Experience-Based Testing:**
- Exploratory testing for user experience flows
- Error guessing for common failure scenarios
- Ad-hoc testing for conference-specific use cases

### Test Types Coverage Matrix

**Functional Testing:**
- User story acceptance criteria validation
- API endpoint functionality verification
- Business rule implementation testing
- Data integrity and persistence testing

**Non-Functional Testing:**
- Performance testing for concurrent user loads
- Security testing for authentication and data protection
- Usability testing for conference attendee workflows
- Compatibility testing across browsers and devices

**Structural Testing:**
- Code coverage analysis (>80% line coverage target)
- API integration testing between frontend and backend
- Database schema and query performance testing

**Change-Related Testing:**
- Regression testing for new feature deployments
- Confirmation testing for bug fixes
- Impact analysis testing for system changes
