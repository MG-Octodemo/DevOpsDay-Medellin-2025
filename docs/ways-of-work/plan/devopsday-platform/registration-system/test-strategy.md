# Test Strategy: DevOpsDay Medellin 2025 Registration System

## Test Strategy Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the DevOpsDay Medellin 2025 Agenda & Registration Platform, applying ISTQB frameworks and ISO 25010 quality standards to ensure a robust, secure, and user-friendly conference management system.

### Testing Scope

The testing scope encompasses:
- **Frontend Components**: React-based user interface with calendar view, authentication forms, and registration workflows
- **Backend Services**: Node.js API endpoints for authentication, talk management, and registration processing
- **Integration Points**: Email service integration, PDF parsing functionality, and database operations
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete user journeys from signup to talk registration and confirmation

### Quality Objectives

- **Functional Correctness**: 100% of acceptance criteria validated through systematic testing
- **Performance Standards**: Response times ≤ 2 seconds for critical user actions
- **Security Compliance**: Zero critical security vulnerabilities, secure authentication and authorization
- **Usability Excellence**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, intuitive user experience across devices
- **Reliability Targets**: 99.5% system availability during conference periods
- **Maintainability**: 80% code coverage with automated test suite

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Areas:**
- User authentication and session management (security impact)
- Talk registration capacity limits (business impact)
- Email confirmation delivery (user experience impact)
- PDF agenda parsing accuracy (data integrity impact)

**Medium Risk Areas:**
- Calendar display performance with large datasets
- Cross-browser compatibility issues
- Mobile responsiveness on various devices

**Low Risk Areas:**
- Static content display
- Basic navigation functionality

### Test Approach

The testing methodology follows a risk-based approach with emphasis on critical user paths and security validation, incorporating both automated and manual testing strategies.

## ISTQB Framework Implementation

### Test Design Techniques Selection

**Equivalence Partitioning:**
- Input validation for email formats, password strength requirements
- Talk capacity validation (within limits vs. exceeding limits)
- User role-based access partitioning (authenticated vs. anonymous users)

**Boundary Value Analysis:**
- Maximum attendee limits for talks (capacity-1, capacity, capacity+1)
- Password length requirements (minimum-1, minimum, maximum, maximum+1)
- Date/time boundaries for talk scheduling and registration deadlines

**Decision Table Testing:**
- User registration workflow (valid/invalid email, password criteria, terms acceptance)
- Talk registration logic (user authenticated, talk available, capacity available, already registered)
- Email notification triggers (successful registration, cancellation, reminders)

**State Transition Testing:**
- User authentication states (anonymous → signed in → signed out)
- Registration states (available → registered → waitlisted → cancelled)
- Talk status transitions (upcoming → ongoing → completed)

**Experience-Based Testing:**
- Exploratory testing for user experience optimization
- Error guessing for edge cases in PDF parsing
- Usability testing for mobile and desktop interfaces

### Test Types Coverage Matrix

**Functional Testing:**
- Feature behavior validation for all user stories
- API endpoint testing for correct request/response handling
- Database CRUD operations validation
- Integration testing between frontend and backend services

**Non-Functional Testing:**
- Performance testing for concurrent user loads
- Security testing for authentication vulnerabilities
- Usability testing for interface design and accessibility
- Compatibility testing across browsers and devices

**Structural Testing:**
- Code coverage analysis targeting 80% line coverage
- API contract testing for interface stability
- Database schema validation and constraint testing

**Change-Related Testing:**
- Regression testing for existing functionality preservation
- Confirmation testing for defect fixes validation
- Impact analysis for feature additions and modifications
