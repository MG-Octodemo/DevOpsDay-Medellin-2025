## ISTQB Framework Application

The documentation applies the following ISTQB test design techniques:

- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Input domain partitioning for systematic test case design
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Edge case identification and validation
- **Decision Table Testing**: Complex business rule validation approaches
- **State Transition Testing**: System state behavior validation strategies
- **Experience-Based Testing**: Exploratory testing and error guessing methodologies

## ISO 25010 Quality Characteristics

The documentation addresses all eight ISO 25010 quality characteristics:

1. **Functional Suitability**: Completeness, correctness, appropriateness
2. **Performance Efficiency**: Time behavior, resource utilization, capacity
3. **Compatibility**: Co-existence, interoperability
4. **Usability**: Interface aesthetics, accessibility, learnability, operability
5. **Reliability**: Fault tolerance, recoverability, availability
6. **Security**: Confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization
7. **Maintainability**: Modularity, reusability, testability
8. **Portability**: Adaptability, installability, replaceability

## Success Metrics and Quality Targets

### Test Coverage Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: 80% line coverage, 90% branch coverage for critical paths
